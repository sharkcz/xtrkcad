?AIntroduction To XTrkCad|||
Welcome to $BXTrkCad$.  $BXTrkCad$ is a computer-aided-design program for designing Model Railroad Layouts.

This manual is a hard copy of the on-line help accessible through the $BHelp$ menu.

New users should run the demonstrations (via the $BHelp|Demos$ menu) to get an overview of the many features of the program.
A number of example files are also available.

$BXTrkCad$ is designed to be easy to use and lets you manipulate tracks much as you would with real track.
Tracks are extended by simply dragging on their End-Points.
Turnouts are automatically aligned when they are placed on existing tracks.
Spiral transition curves (easements) can be automatically generated whenever the track radius changes.
$BXTrkCad$ ensures that all tracks are aligned properly with connecting tracks.

$BXTrkCad$ also lets you create your own parameter files of turnouts, sectional tracks and structures in addition to the parameter files supplied with the program.

Additional features include tunnels, 'post-it' notes,
on-screen ruler, parts list, 99 drawing layers, undo/redo commands,
'Print to BitMap', export DXF files, Elevations, Profile command, Price Lists,
Trains, Flip and Rescale.

?Toverview

?cMS-Windows Installation|||

$BXTrkCad$ is shipped as a self-installing self-expanding program (executable).

Select the $BRun$ item from the $BStart menu$ (on MS-Windows).
Enter $BA:\XTC32310$ (replace 310 by the current version) if installing from the floppy.
Otherwise enter the complete path to $BXTrkCad$ installation program.

Alternatively, you can run $BXTC32310$ directly from MS-Windows Explorer.

The $BXTrkCad$ installation will prompt you for a directory name to
install $BXTrkCad$.  This directory will be the $BXTrkCad Install Directory$.

You will then be prompted to specify the Working Directory.  
You can choose:
?LSo
?LI
the Windows directory, which is directory used in older versions of $BXTrkCad$
?LI
the Install Directory
?LI
Custom Directory, and you will be prompted for the Directory name on the next dialog
?LE
If you have previously installed $BXTrkCad$ in another directory, you may want to copy the $Ixtrkcad.*$ files to the new directory.

The installation program will then proceed to install the files and build a Windows Program Group for $BXTrkCad$.

You can run $BXTrkCad$ by double clicking on the $BXTrkCad$ icon.

?? mswhelp
?? else
?cLinux Installation|||

Where $BVVV$ is the version number:
?LSo
?LI
$BInstalling from .rpm file$

After downloading the .rpm file, do
?W-
rpm -ihv xtrkcad-$BVVV$.i386.rpm
?W+
Replace $B-ihv$ with $B-Uhv$ to upgrade an existing $BXTrkCad$ installation.

?LI
$BInstalling from .tar.gz file$

Chdir to $B/usr/local/lib$ (or where ever you install local commands) do
?W-
tar xvfz xtrkcad-linux-elf.$BVVV$.tar.gz
?W+
This will create the $Bxtrkcad$ directory.  You can move $Bxtrkcad/xtrkcad$ to $B/usr/local/bin/$.

If you install $BXTrkCad$ into another directory, set the $BXTRKCADLIB$ environment variable to point to that directory.

?LE
??

?cQuick Tour|||

When $BXTrkCad$ starts, it displays the $XMain|mainW$ and $XMap|cmdMap$ windows.
The $BMap$ window is used to change the origin of the $BMain$ window when the entire layout
cannot be displayed at one time.

The Menu bar across the top of the $BMain$ window contains standard Windows menus.
Some of these are particularly useful to the new user:
?LSo
?LI
The $BFile|Open$ menu opens existing layout files.
When first installed, the default directory contains some example programs you can look at.
?LI
The $BFile|Exit$ menu exits $BXTrkCad$.  You can also exit by selecting the System menu in the upper left corner of the Window.
?LI
The $BOptions|Setup$ menu specifies the working scale and overall room size.
You will be limited to a roomsize of 96" x 48", unless 
you have $Xregistered|registration$ $BXTrkCad$
?LI
The $BOptions|Preferences$ menu specifies some less frequently changed items.
You can use this menu to choose $XMetric units|perfUnits$.
?LI
The $BHelp$ menu can be used to read the $BXTrkCad$ Help file (which you are reading now).
Also, the $BHelp|Demo$ menu selects a number of demonstrations which illustrate various features of $BXTrkCad$
?LE

?BGeneral Operation|generaloperation||
?Toverview

?cMouse Buttons|||

$BXTrkCad$ uses the left and right mouse buttons when manipulating tracks and
other objects on the layout.
Their meaning depends on the particular command but in general:
?LSo
?LI
$BLeft-Click$ - selects an object or an End-Point.
?LI
$BLeft-Drag$ - modifies an object, such as extending it.
?LI
$BRight-Click$ - displays a popup-menu of commands.
?LI
$BShift-Right-Click$ - displays a popup-menu of command options (for some commands).
?LE

?HdefRightClick
Note: the operation of $BRight-Click$ and $BShift-Right-Click$ can be flipped by $BRight Click$ item on the $XCommand Options|cmdCmdopt$ dialog.
This documentation will refer to $BShift-Right-Click$ as the default operation which displays a popup-menu of command options.

When Moving and Rotating ( Placing Turnouts and Structures,
Moving the Print and Snap Grids, ... ):
?LSo
?LI
$BLeft-Drag$ - moves the objects or grid.
?LI
$BRight-Drag$ - rotates the objects or grid about the pivot point, which is
the point you started the drag operation.
?LE

Some commands use the $BShift$ or $BControl$ key to modify the meaning of button presses.


?cDialogs|||

Most dialogs have three standard buttons:
?LSo
?LI
$BOk$ - Completes the dialog, and the layout is updated with the current changes.
?LI
$BCancel$ - Cancels the dialog, and the layout is reverted to its
previous state.
?LI
$BHelp$ - Invokes the on-line help for the current command or dialog.
?LE

Lengths and Distances can be entered in a variety of formats such as $B12ft 4 1/2in$, $B12' 4.5"$, $B148.500$, $B1.234m$, $B123.4cm$ or $B1234mm$.
Pressing the Equal Sign ($B=$) key after the entry will reformat the value in your $Xpreferred Length Format|lengthFormat$.
You can also press the $Bp$ key to convert a Prototype measurement to a Scale measurement by dividing by the ratio for the current scale.
The $Bs$ key will convert a Scale measurement to a Prototype measurement.


?cAccelerator Keys|||

Most commands have $Xaccelerator keys|commands$ defined which allow you to invoke the command
directly (instead of using the menus or the buttons on the $XTool Bar|toolbar$).

The $BReturn$ key has the same effect as pressing the $BOk$ button on the current dialog.

The $BEscape$ key cancels the current command.
All selected tracks are unselected.
The $XDescribe|cmdDescribe$ or $XSelect|cmdSelect$ command becomes the current command.

The $BPage Up$ and $BPage Down$ keys will zoom out or zoom in.

The arrows key will pan the canvas right, left, up and down. 

The $BDelete$ key invokes the $XDelete|cmdDelete$ command.

Use a hardware Floating Point Unit.
?LI
To speed up initialization, remove unused parameter files (see $XParameter Files|cmdPrmfile$ dialog).
?LI
During moves and rotates, draw tracks $BSimply$ or as $BEnd-Points$, (see the $XCommand Options|cmdCmdopt$ dialog).
Also $XZoom In|editZoomIn$ to reduce the number of tracks that are being displayed.
?LI
If you have to move a lot of track a large distance, create a temporary track at the destination and use the
$XJoin|cmdJoin$ command to move the selected track to join with the temporary track.  Then remove the temporary track.
?LI
Close the Map window if you don't need it to move about the layout.  The $XWindow|windowM$ menu can be used reopen the Map window.
?LI
On the $XDisplay|cmdDisplay$ dialog turn off drawing $BEnd-Points$, decrease the $BTwo Rail Scale$, increase $BMin Grid Spacing$, set $BDraw Ties$ to $BNone$ and turn off $BLive Map$.

$BEnd-Points$

One of the most important concepts in $BXTrkCad$ is the $BEnd-Point$.  
A piece of flex-track has an End-Point at each end.  
An End-Point has a position and an angle and it can be connected to other End-Points.  
The End-Points control where the track is placed 
and how it is connected.

Turnouts have several End-Points (normally 3).  
Turntables have a varying number.
?LS
?LI
?HactiveEndPoint
$BActive End-Point$ - when placing a turnout, the End-Point which is used as a 
'handle' when moved along other tracks.
?LI
?HselectedEndPoint

?CParameter Files|cmdPrmfile||Parameter Files
?Tdialogs
$BParameter Files$ contain Turnout, Sectional Track and Structure definitions.
Parameter Files are loaded and unloaded with the $BParameter Files$ dialog.

?Gprmfile
The dialog contains a list of Parameter Files.  Each file is preceded by a 
checked box (the file is loaded) or an unchecked box (the file is unloaded).
Definitions in loaded files appear on the $XHot Bar|cmdHotBar$ (if they are for the current scale).
If you $Bunload$ a file, then the definitions are removed from the selection lists and the $BHot Bar$.
You can $Breload$ an unloaded file (the $BUnload$ button is changed to $BReload$ if you select an unloaded file).

$BUnloaded$ files are removed from the list when $BXTrkCad$ terminates.

Files can be listed by either their file name or by their Contents Description.
This is controlled by the $BShow File Names$ check box.

The $BBrowse$ button allows you to load other $BParameter Files$ such as provided by other users or by Sillub Technology.

When first installed, all available parameter files are loaded.
You can unload parameter files you don't use to speed up $BXTrkCad$ startup time.

The order in this list controls the order of Turnouts and Structures on the $XHot Bar|cmdHotBar$.
You can move a Parameter File to the end of the list by $BUnloading$ it, and then loading it via the $BBrowse$ button.

?CPrice List|cmdPricelist||Price List
?Tdialogs
The $BPrice List$ dialog allows you to enter the prices of Turnouts, Sectional Track and Structures.  Only the objects from the loaded $XParameter Files|cmdPrmfile$ or $BCustom Designs$ for the current $XScale|optionScale$ are listed.

?Gpricels

The price of Selected object can be changed in the $BCost$ Edit box.

The price of a length of $BFlex Track$ for the current $XScale|optionScale$ is listed at the bottom of the dialog.  You can specify the $BLength$ in $BInches$ or $BCentimeters$.  To specify the price for other $BScales$ change $XScale|optionScale$ on the $XLayout|cmdLayout$ window.

The $XParts List|cmdEnum$ dialog will list the Prices of the selected objects if $BPrices$ Radio Button on the dialog is checked.

?CPrint|cmdPrint||Commands;Print;File Menu
?Tdialogs
The $BPrint$ command (under the $XFile|fileM$ menu) can print all or a 
portion of the layout.

When you select the $BPrint$ command, a grid is drawn on the layout which 
represents each printed page.  
Clicking on the layout will select (or unselect) pages to be printed.

?Gprint
The $BPrint$ dialog contains a number of control areas:
?HcmdPrintSize
The size of each page is controlled by:
?LSo
?LI
$BScale$ - up to 1:1.
?LI
$BWidth, Height$ - scaled size of each page.
?LI
$BMax$ - sets Width and Height to the maximum for the print $BScale$.
?LI
$BSnap Shot$ - adjusts the $BScale$, $BOrigin$ and $BAngle$ to produce a one-page snap shot of the layout.
?LI
$BFormat$ - Portrait or Landscape.
?LE

You can manually enter the $BWidth$ and $BHeight$ values to override the 
maximum values.  
You cannot enter values larger than the page size times the $BScale$.

The $BPrint Order$ option controls the printing order of the pages.
Relative to the Print Grid:
?LSo
?LI
$BNormal$ order is Columns first, Top to Bottom, Left to Right.
?LI
$BReverse$ order is Rows first, Left to Right, Bottom to Top.
?LE

Whether tracks are printed with one or two lines (representing the center line and rails) depends on the $BPrint Scale$.
If this value is smaller than or equal to twice the $XTwo Rail Scale|cmdPref$ on the $XDisplay|cmdDisplay$ dialog then tracks are drawn with two lines.
This corresponds to the way tracks are drawn on the main window,
adjusted to account for the greater resolution of most printers.
At 1:1 tracks are also drawn with a center line.

?? mswword
?P
??
The other options:
?LSo
?LI
$BEngineering Data$ - show title, user, date and other information in a box at the bottom of the printout.
?LI
$BIgnore Page Margins$ - use the physical page size.  
This allows the printouts to abut without trimming.
?LI
$BPrint Registration Marks$ - at 1:1 scale, print location markers every 3" (or 10cm).
This option is only enabled at 1:1.
This is useful for aligning multiple pages printed at different angles.
?LI
$BPrint Snap Grid$ - if the $XSnap Grid|cmdGrid$ is visible then it may be drawn on the printout.
This option is only enabled if the $BSnap Grid$ is visible.
?LI
$BPrint Rulers$ - print rulers on all edges of the page.
This option is only enabled if the $BAngle$ is $B0.000$.
?LI
$BPrint Roadbed Outline$ - lines representing the edge of the Roadbed.
The Roadbed will be printed if the $BWidth$ is greater than the track gauge.  Note: this option is most useful at 1:1.
This option is disabled if tracks would be drawn with only one line (instead of two).
?LE

?HcmdPrintOrient
The orientation of the print grid is controlled by:
?LSo
?LI
$BX$ - X co-ordinate.
?LI
$BY$ - Y co-ordinate.
?LI
$BAngle$ - of the grid.
?LE

You can set these values directly or by dragging on the layout.
$BShift-Left-Drag$ moves the grid and $BShift-Right-Drag$ rotates the grid.
The $BReset$ button resets the values to 0.

The $BPrint$ button prints the selected pages and removes the $BPrint$ dialog.  It is not enabled until you have selected some pages to print.

The $BSetup$ button invokes the 
$XPrinter Setup|printSetup|Help,Misc,Printer Setup$ dialog.

The $BClear$ button unselects all selected pages.

$BSuggested Uses:$

Use the $BSnapshot$ button to set the scale and orientation for a one-page printout of the layout.  Also set $BEngineering Data$ to add the Layout Title, Scale and other data for a summary.

Use $Xlayers|cmdLayer$ to control which tracks are visible (and printed).  Put benchwork, scenery or different tracks levels in separate layers and hide the layers you are not working with.

To transfer the drawing to the layout without printing at 1:1, make
the $XSnap Grid|cmdGrid$ visible and orient it to match your room or
layout table.
Check the $BPrint Snap Grid$ toggle and use the printed grid to transfer
measurements to your layout space.
You may want to change the $Xcolor|cmdRgbcolor$ of the $BSnap Grid$ to make it more visible on the printout.

When you print multiple pages you can check $BIgnore Page Margins$
so pages can be placed next to each other.
The tracks will line up
correctly without trimming or overlapping the pages. 
Note: there will be an unprintable margin around the edge of the page.

If you print at 1:1 for direct transfer to the sub-roadbed,
check $BPrint Roadbed Outline$ and set $BWidth$ to show lines for making cuts.

If you make printouts in strips at different angles at 1:1 (to follow tracks around a curve), check $BPrint Registration Marks$ to be able to align the separate strips.

?CPrint to BitMap|cmdOutputbitmap||File Menu;Print,BitMap
?Tdialogs
This menu item creates a BitMap file of the layout.

?Gbitmap
The $BBitMap$ dialog specifies the style and size of the BitMap.  The three toggle
buttons ($BPrint Titles$, $BPrint Borders$ and $BPrint Centerline$) control whether the $XLayout Title|optionTitle$, the borders or Track Centerlines are printed on the BitMap.
The size of the BitMap is smaller if these are disabled.

Printing the Track Centerlines (also seen when zoomed in 1:1) is useful when you later print the BitMap full size for laying out track.

If the $XSnap Gird|cmdGrid$ is visible then it will be printed on the BitMap.

The $Bdpi$ (or $Bdpcm$ if using $XMetric units|perfUnits$) control specifies the 
number of pixels per inch (or centimeter) in the BitMap.
You can enter values from 0.1 to 100.
Larger values will result in a larger BitMap file.
BitMaps must be less than 32000 pixels in height or width.

The BitMap width, height and approximate file size is indicated.

Note: This command can create a very large file and consume a lot of memory and time.

Pressing the $BOk$ button invokes a $BFile Save$ dialog so you can choose the
file name for the BitMap.

The format of the file depends on the Operating System: on MS-Windows it is a Windows Bitmap (.BMP) file, on Linux it is a X11 Pixmap (.XPM) file.

?CTurnout Designer|cmdTurnoutNew||Commands;Turnouts;Sectional Track
?Tdialogs
The $BTurnout Designer$
allows you to define new turnouts and sectional track pieces.
It is invoked by $BTurnout Designer$ item on the $XTools|toolsM$ menu.

The $BTurnout Designer$ uses a number of different dialogs 
(one for each type of turnout or sectional track).

This dialog is for a Regular turnout.

?Gturndes
Each dialog shows a diagram of the turnout and has fields to enter dimensions.  
The dimensions should be as accurate as possible.  
The various types of dimensions are:
?LSo
?LI
?HcmdTurnoutNewLen
$BLength$ - measured from the base of the turnout to the centerline at the end of 
the turnout.  
Length is measured parallel to the centerline of the straight leg of the turnout.  
For track that ends on a curve (such as the curved leg of a regular turnout) 
measure the distance from the base to each rail and average the values.
?LI
?HcmdTurnoutNewOff
$BOffset$ - measured from the centerline of the straight leg of the turnout to 
the centerline of the track at the end of the turnout.
?LI
?HcmdTurnoutNewAngle
$BAngle$ - angle at the end of turnout to the centerline of the straight leg 
of the turnout.  
This angle may not be the same as the $BFrog$ angle of the turnout if the rails curve past the $BFrog$.  
The $BFrog Number|Degrees$ Radio button group controls whether the value is 
expressed in Frog Number or Degrees.
?LI
?HcmdTurnoutNewManufacturer
$BManufacturer$ - name of the Manufacturer
?LI
?HcmdTurnoutNewDesc
$BDescription$ - description of the turnout including size and rail code number (eg. 'Left Hand #4')
?LI
?HcmdTurnoutNewPartno
$B#$ - part number (eg. '999-123').  
?LI
$BRoadbed Width$ - if greater than the track gauge then lines are drawn along the edges of the Turnout to represent the attached Roadbed available on some types of Sectional Track and Turnouts.
?LI
$BLine Width$ - the width of the Roadbed lines, measured in pixels when the layout $XDrawing Scale|editZoom$ is 1:1.
?LI
$BColor$ - color of the Roadbed lines.
?LE

The Rail height (Code) can be added to the $BManufacturer$ (eg. Peco-55) or the $BDescription$ (eg. Medium Right, Code 55).

The Scale is the current scale from the $XScale|optionScale$ $BDrop Down List$ on the $XLayout|cmdLayout$ dialog.  

$BManufacturer$, $BDescription$ and $BPart Number (#)$ comprise the Title of the turnout.
These values are used in the $XTurnout Selection|cmdTurnout$ dialog and the $Xparts list|cmdEnum$.
For regular and curved turnouts there are $BDescriptions$ and $BPart Numbers$ for the Right and Left hand turnouts.
 

The $BPrint$ button prints a full size diagram of the turnout.  
You can use this to check your dimensions and make any required changes.  
You should expect to make several printouts as you refine your dimensions.

The $BOk$ button completes the design.  
The new turnout is added to the list in the $BTurnout Selection$ dialog.  
The turnout data is saved in the $Xxtrkcad.cus|directories$ file for the next time 
you use $BXTrkCad$.  
Please consider contributing this information for others to use.
You can change the Parameters or Title of existing designs by using the $XCustom Management|cmdCustmgm$ dialog.

?? mswword
?P
??

The $BCancel$ button removes the $BTurnout Designer$ dialog.

It is best to start by marking the End-Points of the turnout on a piece of 
paper.  
Extend the curved leg of the turnout (try attaching a straight sectional track) 
and measure the angle.  
Frog numbers are easiest to calculate.

Enter your data and press $BPrint$, if you have an accurate printer.  
Check the dimensions of the turnout against the printout and make adjustments 
as necessary.  
Concentrate on the lengths and offsets first, then adjust the angles.

The resulting turnout is an approximation.  
In particular the curves will not be correct, but this is not important for 
placing turnouts.

You can use the $XGroup|cmdGroup$ command to add cosmetic details to the $BTurnout$ definitions.

?CCar|cmdCarpart||Tools Menu;Car Inventory;Trains
?Tdialogs
This dialog is used to create and edit Car Items.  It is also used to create and edit Car Part and Prototype definitions.

This dialog is invoked from the $XCar Inventory|cmdCarinv$ and the $XCustom Management|cmdCustmgm$ dialogs.

This dialog can be displayed in three different ways to enter $BCar Items$, $BCar Part$ definitions or $BPrototype$ definitions.

The $BAdd$ button creates a new definition.  The dialog remains open so you can enter multiple definitions.  You can $BClose$ the dialog when you are finished.  If you are editing an existing definition then the Add button will be replaced by the $BUpdate$ button which updates the selected definition and closes the dialog.

The $BNew$ button on the $BCar Item$ dialog invokes the $BCar Part$ or $BCar Prototype$ dialog which you can use to create new part or prototype definitions for your cars.
The $BNew$ button on the $BCar Part$ dialog invokes the $BCar Prototype$ dialog.

$BCar Item dialog$

?Gcaritem

The dialog contains:
?LSo
?LI
$BCar Description$ which contains lists of $BManufacturer$, $BPrototype$ and $BPart Number$ which are used to select the Car Part.
The $BManufacturer$ list contains the entries $BCustom$ and $BUnknown$ for special Car Parts.  For these entries you can enter the $BPart Number$ and $BDescription$ fields.

If the manufacturer of your car is not listed in the $BManufacturer$ list you can type in the new name.
Also, if the $BPart$ is not listed you can enter a new part number.
The new part will be added to the list of $XCustom Car Parts|cmdCustmgm$.
?LI
The $BMode$ Radio button group lets you choose between the $BInformation$ controls described here or the $BCustomize$ controls described in the next section.
You would use the $BCustomize$ option to change Roadname, Number or Color if you have repainted the car or to adjust the dimensions.
?LI
Details about the individual Car Item such as $BIndex$, $BPrice$ and $BCondition$, $BDates$ and $BNotes$.  The $BIndex$ value must be unique for all Car Items.

To enter multiple $BNew Cars$ you can set the $BQuantity$ field to a value greater than one.  The $BNumbers$ Radio button group specifies whether the new Car's numbers will be sequential (such as 1234, 1235, ...) or repeated.
?LI
$BMessage Line$ which will contain instructions if there any fields that need to be completed.

?LE

$BCar Part dialog$

?Gcarpart

This dialog is similiar the the $BCar Item$ dialog except that the $BCar Item Information$ section is not displayed.
The $BManufacturer$ Drop Down List is editable so you can enter a new Manufacturer, and you must enter a $BPart Number$.
If you are adding a new Car Part, the $BPart Number$ field will be incremented (if it is a numeric value) so you can enter a number of Car Parts.

The middle section contains:
?LSo
?LI
The $BRoad$, $BReporting Mark$, $BNumber$ and $BColor$.
You can choose a $BRoadname$ from the list of known Roadnames or enter a new value.  If known, the Reporting Mark (Roadname abbreviation) is filled in.
?LI
$BCar Dimensions$ which contains the major dimensions of the Car and how the coupler is mounted on the car.
The $BCoupler Length$ is measured from the edge of the car body to the pulling face of the coupler.
It is equivalent to half the separation between two coupled cars.

When entering values, the $Bp$ key will convert a Prototype measurement to a Scale measurement.

The length dimensions have the following relationship, so changing one value will affect the others:
?W-
$BCoupled Length = Car Length + 2 * Coupler Length$
?W+
?LI
A diagram is displayed showing the position of the trucks and couplers.

$BCar Prototype dialog$

?Gcarproto

This dialog is used to create or edit Prototype definitions.

The first section contains the Name of the $BPrototype$ and its $BType$.


If this dialog was invoked from the $BCar Item$ or $BCar Part$ dialog then the Prototype diagram will be copied from the selected part.
Otherwise, the Prototype is drawn as the default image which is a simple Blue rectangle or, if it is a locomotive, with one end angled.

The $BImport$ button creates a Prototype definition from the $XSelected|cmdSelect$ lines and shapes.
To use this, first create a set of shapes (Filled Rectangles, Polygons, Circles, Lines etc) using the $XDraw|cmdDraw$ commands on the Main Canvas.
$BSelect$ the shapes and use the $BImport$ button.
The $BReset$ button will reset the figure to the default image.

If this dialog is invoked by the $BNew$ button on the $BCar$ or $BCar Part$ dialog then the initial image will be copied from the Prototype displayed on those dialogs.
You can use this to make variations of existing Prototypes.

The $BColor$ control on the $BCar Part$ dialog will replace any color of the $BImported$ shapes which is not Black or a shade of gray with the selected hue.

The $BFlip$ button flips the diagram horizontally.  For locomotives, the forward direction is to the right.

Unlike the other dialogs, dimensions in this dialog are in prototype units.
When entering values, the $Bs$ key will convert a Scale measurement to a Prototype measurement.


?CGroup Dialog|cmdGroup||Commands;Group;Structures
?Tdialogs

The $BGroup$ command (on the $XTools|toolsM$ menu) combines $XSelected|cmdSelect$ $XLines and Shapes|cmdDraw$ to create $XStructures|cmdHotBar$.
You can give the $XStructure|cmdHotBar$ a Title consisting of Manufacturer, Description and Part Number on the $BGroup$ dialog.
The Title will be prepopulated with the Title of the last $BStructure$ you $XUngrouped|toolsM$.

You can include $BTurnouts$, $BSectional$, $BStraight$ or $BCurved$ tracks in the selected
objects which allows you to add cosmetic details to a $BTurnout$ definitions, or create a new
$BTurnout$ definition.

To modify a $BStructure$ or $BTurnout$ definition, first place the object on the layout, $XSelect|cmdSelect$ and then $BUngroup$ the object.
Now the parts of the object can be edited using the $XModify|cmdModify$, $XDraw|cmdDraw$ or other commands.
Once completed, select the object parts and use the $BGroup$ command to update the definition (or create a new one by changing the Title).

The $BGroup$ dialog shows the Title (Manufacturer, Description and Part Number) of the new definition.
The initial values are based on any selected Turnouts and Structures or on the last object $XUngrouped|toolsM$.
The dialog also contains a toggle button, $BReplace with new group?$ which is used if you want to replace the selected objects with the new definition.

The definition data will be added to the $Xxtrkcad.cus|xtrkcad_cus$ file for later use.
Please consider contributing this information for others to use.

If you modify a definition from a $BXTrkCad$ Library parameter file, the new definition will replace the existing definition on the $XHot Bar|cmdHotBar$, otherwise it will be added to the end of the $BHot Bar$.
You can use the $XCustom Management|cmdCustmgm$ dialog to change the Title or delete Custom definitions.

?CUpdate Turnouts and Structures|cmdRefreshSpecial||Commands;Turnouts;Structures
?Tdialogs

This command Updates (or Refreshes) Selected Turnouts, Sectional Tracks and Structures on your layout with definitions from the loaded $XParameter Files|cmdPrmfile$.
Each object that is found in a Parameter File is updated with the current definition. 

If an object can not be found or if the new definition does not fit (same number of End-Points and all the End-Points have the same position and angle) then a dialog is displayed which contains suitable definitions that you can choose from.
You can $BSkip$ the current object or $BCancel$ to skip all the remaining objects.

If an object has been Updated then it is Unselected, otherwise it will remain Selected at the end of this command.


?CLayers Dialog|cmdLayer||Commands;Layers
?Tdialogs

Each object is contained a Layer.
Objects which are created independently of other objects (such as $XStraight tracks|cmdStraight$ or $XText|cmdText$) are created in the current Layer.
Objects which are associated with other objects (such as tracks created by the $XModify|cmdModify$ or $XJoin|cmdJoin$ commands) are created in the same Layer as the associated object(s).

The $BLayers$ dialog allows you to change various attributes of each of the 99 $BLayers$.

Note: these attributes are stored with the current Layout.  They are not applied when you change Layouts.

?Gdlayer

The Drop List at the top of the dialog selects the $BLayer$ you are interested in.
Layers with some objects in the layer are preceeded by a $B+$.

The $BName$ Edit Box contains the name of the $BLayer$.  This name is listed in the $BCurrent Layer$ Drop List on the $XToolbar|toolbar$.  Also the $BName$ is displayed as the Balloon Help for the corresponding $BLayer Button$.

The $BColor$ Button specifies the color of tracks if $XLayer Colors|optionColorLayers$ Radio Button on the $BDisplay$ dialog is checked.

The $BVisible$ Toggle Button controls whether the $BLayer$ is drawn on the $XMain|mainW$ window.

The $BFrozen$ Toggle Button indicates that tracks in that $BLayer$ can not be modified or deleted.

The $BOn Map$ Toggle Button controls whether the $BLayer$ is drawn on the $XMap|cmdMap$ window.

You cannot uncheck $BVisible$ or check $BFrozen$ for the $BCurrent Layer$.

The $BCount$ field displays the number of objects in this Layer.

The bottom of the dialog contains the $BNumber of Layer Buttons$ Integer Edit Box. 
This controls the $BLayer Buttons$ displayed on the $XTool bar|toolbar$. 
Up to the first 20 $BLayer Buttons$ can be displayed.
You should use the first 20 layers for layers which you will be showing and hiding frequently.

?Gblayer

The $BLayer Buttons$ on the $XToolbar|toolbar$ control which Layer is the $Bcurrent Layer$ and which $BLayers$ are displayed on the Main Canvas.

The current Layer is selected by picking a value from the Drop Down Layer list.
If the Layer you've selected was not visible, it will be shown.

You can hide (or show if not visible) the different Layers by pushing one of the $BLayer Buttons$ on the toolbar (if you have configured the $Xtoolbar|toolbarM$ to show the Layer buttons).
If a Layer is not visible then the corresponding Layer button will be dimmed and
the underscore will be removed.
You cannot hide the current Layer.
These buttons are a short cut for the $BVisible$ Toggle button on the $BLayers$ dialog for the corresponding Layer.

The color of each layer button shows the color that will be used to draw 
tracks in that layer, if
you select $XColor Layers|optionColorLayers$ on the $BDisplay$ dialog.

Note: on some systems (with 256 color window drivers) all possible colors may not be displayed on the button faces.
In this case, Windows chooses the closest matching color which may be the same as the button background color.
In this case the number on the button will not be visible, however the correct color will be used to color objects in that layer.

Any selected objects are unselected when the Layer is made not visible.
If a Layer is not visible, you cannot select objects in the Layer.
It is as if the objects do not exist until you show the Layer again.

The $BMove To Current Layer$ command on $XTools menu|toolsM$ will move all $Xselected|cmdSelect$ tracks to the current Layer.

Objects are drawn on the map window, if the Layer they are on has $BOn Map$ checked.

?CEasements|cmdEasement|bease|Options Menu;Join Tracks;Easements;Spiral Transition Curves
?Tdialogs
Easements (or spiral transition curves) can be used to connect tracks with 
differing radii.  
This ensures a smooth transition from one track to another and helps prevent 
jerky motion.

Easements can be created every time you $XJoin|cmdJoin$ tracks, 
$XExtend|cmdModify$ a track or create a $XTangent|cmdModify$ track.  
It is best to turn $BEasements$ off when using sectional track.

When using easements, an error message will be generated if the tracks have a radius 
that is too small or are too short for the transition curve.

The $BEasement$ dialog is invoked from the $XOptions|optionM$ menu.

?Geasew

?LI
$BValue$ - allows fine tuning of the easement parameters 
(restricted to values >= 0.5).

$BX$ - offset between a straight and curved track.
?LI
$BL$ - length of the transition track.
?LI
Radio button group with $BNone$, $BSharp$, $BNormal$ and $BBroad$ - corresponding 
to $BValue$s of 0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0.  
Select $BNone$ to turn off easements.
?LE

$BR$, $BX$ and $BL$ values are read-only.

These values indicate the worst case of joining a straight 
track with a curve of radius $BR$.  
The two tracks are separated by the offset $BX$, and the easement curve extends 
for $BL/2$ inches or centimeters to each side.

The formula used to draw easements is:
?W-
x = l*l*l / (6*R*L)
r = L*R/l
?W+
where
?LSo
?LI
$Bl$ is the distance along the tangent to the easement.
?LI
$BR$ is the final radius of the easement.
?LI
$BL$ is the total length of the easement along the tangent.
?LI
$Bx$ is the offset from the tangent at $Bl$.
?LI
$Br$ is the radius of easement curve at $Bl$.
?LE

The Easement Button on the $XMain Window|mainW$ changes its label to indicate the current Easement value.
?? mswword
?P
??
The following diagrams illustrates the $BR$, $BX$ and $BL$ values and the resulting easement curve.

?Geaseex1

?Geaseex2

If you use curves with radius larger than $BR$ or are connecting two curves 
(that bend in the same direction) then the easement curve will be shorter and 
the offset smaller.  
If the computed offset is small then no easement is generated.  

A curved track that bends in one direction and then bends in the opposite 
direction is an $BS-curve$.  
This will generate the worst case easement which is two easement curves 
placed end to end.

?BHot Bar|cmdHotBar||Turnout;Structure;Hot Bar
?Tcommands
?Gbhotbar

The $BHot Bar$ is a scrolling list of all the Turnout, Sectional Track and Structures available from the $XTurnout|cmdTurnout$ and $XStructure|cmdStructure$ commands.
You can optionally display the Description and/or Part Number under each object by the $BHot Bar Labels$ radio button on the $XDisplay|cmdDisplay$ dialog.

The two arrow buttons move the list one object to the Right or Left.  Holding down the Shift key will move the list by greater amounts.  About eight Shift-Clicks will jump from the start to the end of the list.  Also, pressing the keys $B1$ through $B9$ and $B0$ will jump to relative spots on the list.

$BRight-Click$ will display a popup-menu of the contents of the $BHot Bar$ which you can also use to jump through the list.

Objects are selected by clicking on an object and then $BDragging$ on the Main window.

?cTurnouts:|||

$BTurnouts$ have an $XActive End-Point|activeEndPoint$ which is the handle used to position the $BTurnout$.
You can change the $BActive End-Point$ by a $BShift-Left-Click$ which causes the next End-Point to become Active.

If you $BLeft-Drag$ a turnout onto a track, the
$XActive End-Point|activeEndPoint$ is aligned with the selected track.
On flex-track, you can flip the turnout by moving the cursor from one side of the track
centerline to the other.
On another turnout, the new turnout will be placed at the End-Point closest to the cursor.

$BXTrkCad$ will automatically connect the turnout's End-Points to any other tracks that they are aligned to.  The number of End-Points that will be connected is displayed on the Status Bar, as well as the Maximum displacement between these End-Points and the tracks they will be connected to.  $BXTrkCad$ will adjust the position of the Turnout to give you the best fit for locating the turnout.  You can override this adjustment by holding down the $BShift$ key while $BDragging$.

You can also $XRight-Drag|rightdrag$ to rotate the turnout on the layout.
$XShift-Right-Click|defRightClick$ displays a popup-menu allowing you to rotate the turnout by various angles.

When you press the $BSpace$ key, the turnout is positioned on the layout.
Any tracks that are aligned with any of the turnout's End-Points will be
connected to the turnout automatically.
If you are using the $XTurnout|cmdTurnout$ command then you can also click the $BOk$ button on the dialog.

If you choose another turnout or change commands after beginning to place a turnout on the layout, the turnout will be created if it is attached to another track.
Otherwise it will be removed.

If the Drawing Scale is smaller or equal to the $XLabel Scale|optionLabelScale$ then
Turnouts will be labeled with their description when drawn.
The individual labels can be can be turned off by the $XMove Label|cmdMoveLabel$ command, or all Turnout labels can be disabled by using the $XDisplay|cmdDisplay$ dialog.
As well, the length of any connected Flex-track will be indicated at each End-Point.

?cStructures:|||

$BStructures$ are placed on the Layout in same way as $BTurnouts$ except that there is no $BActive End-Point$ and Structures do not align with existing tracks.



?BStraight Track|cmdStraight|bstraigh|Commands;Straight Track;Flex-track;Creating Tracks
?Tcommands
The straight track is a created by selecting the first End-Point and then 
dragging the cursor to the where you want the second End-Point.

?BCurved Track|cmdCurve|bcurve|Commands;Curved Track;Flex-track;Creating Tracks
?Tcommands

Creating a Curve is a two step operation.  
The four methods (with their accelerator keys) used to create a Curved Track are:

?LS
?LI
$Gbcurve1$ ($BControl-4$) Drag from one End-Point in the direction of the Curve at that point and release.
Click and Drag to position the second End-Point.
?LI
$Gbcurve3$ ($BControl-5$) Drag from one of the End-Points to the Center of the Curved track and release. 
Click and Drag to position the second End-Point.
?LI
$Gbcurve3$ ($BControl-6$) Drag from the Center of the Curved track to one of the End-Points and release. 
Click and Drag to position the second End-Point.
?LI
$Gbcurve4$ ($BControl-7$) Drag from one End-Point to the other End-Point to form the Chord of the Curve and release.
Click on the center of the track and Drag to form the Curve.
?LE

The button to the left of the Curved track button selects which method will be invoked by the Toolbar button.

In all cases, two Red arrow heads will be drawn after the first step to indicate where you can Drag to complete the second step.

A straight track will be created if the second End-Point is lined up with the 
first End-Point.

If the $XSnap Grid|cmdGrid$ is enabled then the End-Points will be constrained to the grid.

Optionally, the curve center point and radius can be displayed for the Curve.
This is enabled by the $XMove Label|cmdMoveLabel$ command.

?BCircle Track|cmdCircle|bcircle|Commands;Curved Track;Flex-track;Creating Tracks
?Tcommands
A circle track is a special form of a curved track that extends 360 and has 
no End-Points.  
The three methods (with their accelerator keys) used to create a Circle Track are:

?LS
?LI
$Gbcircl1$ ($BControl-8$) Use the Fixed Radius specified on the $BCircle Radius$ control displayed on the $XStatus Bar|statusBar$.  Drag the Circle track into position.
?LI
$Gbcircl2$ ($BControl-9$) Drag from the edge of the Circle track to the Center.
?LI
$Gbcircl3$ ($BControl-0$) Drag from the Center of the Circle track to the edge.
?LE

The button to the left of the Circle track button selects which method will be invoked by the Toolbar button.

If the $XSnap Grid|cmdGrid$ is enabled then the Circle center will be constrained to the grid.

Circle tracks are useful for fitting curves into corners and other tight places.  
Also, they are good to establish initial layouts and finding out "what will fit".

You can join to and from circles, after which they become curved tracks.


?BHelix Track|cmdHelix|bhelix|Command;Curved Track;Flex-track;Creating Tracks;Helix
?Tcommands
A helix track is used to change the elevation of track in a restricted space.
A helix is drawn as a circle of track, but in 3 dimensions it would resemble a cork screw or the pattern of threads on a bolt.

?Gchelix
A helix is defined by the number of $BTurns$ and $BRadius$.

The helix dialog allows you to calculate these values based other parameters such as the $BElevation Difference$, $BGrade$ and $BVertical Separation$.
The $BAngular Separation$ is the difference in degrees between the tracks entering and exiting the helix.
Changing any of these values effects other values.
For example, increasing the $BRadius$ decreases the $BGrade$.
Changing the number of $BTurns$ affects the $BVertical Separation$ and either the $BRadius$ or $BGrade$.

In the case where different parameters could be affected
(for instance changing $BElevation Difference$ can affect $BRadius$ or $BGrade$)
the last parameter you changed will be preserved.
If you set the $BGrade$ and then $BElevation Difference$ then the $BRadius$ will be adjusted.

Changing $BVertical Separation$ affects $BTurns$ which must be an integer value (no fractions), and this in turn affects the $BVertical Separation$.
When you set $BVertical Separation$ you are specifying the minimum separation which is adjusted upwards to the actual value.

Note: only the $BRadius$ and $BTurns$ are used when creating the helix.
After joining the helix to other tracks, you will want to establish the heights of the End-Points at each end of the helix.
You can use the $XElevation|cmdElev$ command to do this.

A helix is placed the same way as a $XCircle Track|cmdCircle$ with the addition that you specify the number of turns as well the as the radius of the helix.  Then the helix is dragged into position on the layout.

You can join to a helix in the same way you join to a circle.  However, once joined the helix is still drawn as a circle of track.

A label for the helix is drawn at it's the center.
If the elevations are set (either by a Defined Elevation point or connecting to a Defined Elevation point) for the two ends of the helix then the label contains the computed grade and vertical separation between layers as well as the number of turns and total length.
The label can be moved or turned off by the $XMove Label|cmdMoveLabel$ command.


?BTurnouts and Sectional Track|cmdTurnout|bturnout|Commands;Turnouts;Sectional Track
?Tcommands
Turnouts (and sectional track) are created by the $BTurnout$ command.  
When you select the turnout command, the $BTurnout Selection$ dialog is 
displayed which contains a list of available turnouts and sectional track for the 
$Xcurrent scale|optionScale$ and a diagram of the selected turnout.

You can use the $XParameter File|cmdPrmfile$ dialog to control what Turnouts are displayed.

?Gturnsel
Select a turnout from the scrolling list.  
A picture of the selected turnout is drawn in the diagram canvas.  
You can pick the $XActive End-Point|activeEndPoint$ by clicking on an 
End-Point in the diagram.  
The $XActive End-Point|activeEndPoint$ is indicated by a highlighted square.

The $BNew$ button invokes the 
$XTurnout Designer|cmdTurnoutNew|Help,Misc,TurnoutDesigner$ dialog.  
This button displays a popup-menu list of various types of turnouts and 
sectional track.

The $BTurnout Selection$ window will disappear while dragging on the layout if
the $BHide$ Check Box on the dialog is set.
This is useful if you have a small screen.

See the $XHot Bar|cmdHotBar$ command for details on placing Turnouts on the layout.


?BHandlaid Turnouts|cmdHandLaidTurnout|bhndldto|Commands;Turnouts;Flex-track
?Tcommands

Handlaid turnouts are created by specifying 3 values:
?LSo
?LI
position of the $XFrog|defTurnoutFrog$
?LI
angle of the $BFrog$ (the frog number)
?LI
position of the $XPoints|defTurnoutPoints$
?LE

First select the position for the $XFrog|defTurnoutFrog$ on an existing track and then $BDrag$ away to specify the angle of the $BFrog$.
The angle in degrees and equivalent frog number is displayed on the status bar.
When you release, the line indicating the angle jumps to one side of the track to show you the center line of the new leg of the turnout.

Next $BClick$ and $BDrag$ to position the $XPoints|defTurnoutPoints$ for the turnout.  As you $BDrag$, tracks will be drawn showing the turnout.  When you release the turnout is created.

You cannot place the $BFrog$ or $BPoints$ on a turnout, circle or helix.  However, you can create overlapping Handlaid Turnouts.

There are constraints on where you can place the $BPoints$ in relation to the $BFrog$.
You cannot place the $BPoints$ too close the $BFrog$.
When placing Handlaid Turnout on a curved track you may get unexpected results, especially when placing the $BPoints$ a long way from the $BFrog$.
Try changing the $BFrog$ angle to get different results.

Note: the drawing is an approximation to show the location of the $BPoints$ and $BFrog$.
The piece of track considered (by $BXTrkCad$) to be a Handlaid Turnout is a short section of track located at the $BPoints$ and extending towards the $BFrogs$.
Other track segments are created between the $BPoints$ and $BFrog$ and a short straight segment is drawn after the $BFrog$.
These other segments are independent of the turnout and can be removed or modified, although this is probably not a good idea.

You can change this value before dragging the turntable into position.

The $XModify|cmdModify$ command can be 
used to create turntable stall tracks.  
Select the turntable and drag the stall track to the proper angle and length.  
You can also connect to a turntable with the $XJoin|cmdJoin$ command.

The $BTurntable Angle$ control on the $XCommand Options|cmdCmdopt$ dialog controls how 
closely you can place tracks connected to a turntable.  
If you want to create stall tracks every 7.5, set the $BTurntable Angle$ 
control to 7.5 and place the track as close to each other as allowed.  
$BXTrkCad$ makes sure they will be separated by the correct angle.

?BParallel Track|cmdParallel|bparalle|Commands;Modify Track;Parallel Tracks
?Tcommands
You can create a new track parallel to any straight, curved or easement track.

?Gcparalle
The $BParallel Separation$ control displays the current separation between 
parallel tracks.  
You can change this value before selecting a track.  
The value must be greater than 0.0.

Select the track you want to parallel, and the new parallel track will appear 
beside it.  
You control which side the new track will be on by moving the cursor from one 
side to the other of the selected track.

This is very useful for creating sidings and yards.

You cannot create tracks parallel to turnouts or 
sectional track.

It is possible to create tracks that abut 
(the End-Points are very close and aligned).
These End-Points will be automatically connected.


?BModify Track|cmdModify|bmodify|Commands;Modify Track;Changing Tracks
?Tcommands
The $BModify$ command is used to change existing tracks and to extend them with new tracks.
This command works with an unconnected End-Point of a track.

Either the Left mouse button (for changing length or creating a tangent track) or
the Right mouse button (for extending with a new track) is used to select the
unconnected End-Point.

Any tracks that are created during the Modify command will have the following properties inherited from the first track: selected state, hidden state, scale, track gauge and Layer.

?cChanging Track Length:|||

$XLeft-Drag|leftdrag$ is used to change the length of a track segment,
 (or Table Edge, Benchwork, Dimension Line or Line).

$BLeft-Dragging$ the End-Point of a turnout (or other sectional track) causes a 
straight track to be created from the selected End-Point to the cursor.

You can change the length of a curve to form an almost complete circle if 
you drag the cursor almost to the other End-Point.  
Going past the other End-Point creates a very small curve.  
You cannot create a curve of greater than 360.

$BLeft-Dragging$ the End-Point of a $XTable Edge|cmdDraw$ allows you to move the End-Point to a new position.
If you move close to the End-Point of another Table Edge then the End-Point will be moved to it. 

?cCreating a Tangent to a Curve:|||

If you $BLeft-Drag$ beyond the radius of a 
$XCurved track|cmdCurve$ (but not a $XCircle|cmdCircle$)
a Tangent to the Curve will be created.

This will begin when the distance from the Curved track center to the cursor is
greater than 110% of the radius.
If you then move the cursor within the radius of the Curve then the $BChanging Track Length$
mode is in effect.

The Curve is shortened or lengthened as required.  

If $Xeasements|cmdEasement|Help,Misc,Easements$ are enabled then an easement curve 
will be generated (if required) to connect the old and new tracks.

?cChanging Track Radius:|||

$BShift-Left-Drag$ is used to change the Radius of $BStraight$ or $BCurved$ track segment.

Hold down the $BShift$ key and select the unconnected End-Point or a track.  The other End-Point must be connected to another track.  Now $BDrag$ the unconnected End-Point to change the Radius of the track.  Straight tracks can be made into Curved tracks and vice versa.

?cExtending a Track:|||

$XRight-Drag|rightdrag$ is used to 
extend a track with a straight or curved track.  
The selected End-Point determines the position and angle of the first 
End-Point of the new track.  
The cursor is dragged to set the second End-Point.
This is similar to creating a $Xcurved track|cmdCurve$.

A curved or straight track will be created, depending on the position of the 
second End-Point.

If $Xeasements|cmdEasement|Help,Misc,Easements$ are enabled then an easement curve 
will be generated (if required) to connect the old and new tracks.


?BJoin Tracks|cmdJoin|bjoin|Commands;Join Tracks;Easements;Spiral Transition Curves
?Tcommands
Any two tracks can be joined together.  
$BXTrkCad$ ensures that the connecting track is aligned properly.

?cJoining With New Track:|||

$BLeft-Click$ to select the first unconnected End-Point.  
A Red dot will be drawn to remind which track you selected.  
Then $BLeft-Drag$ to select the second unconnected End-Point and drag along the track to vary the radius 
of the connecting track.

$BXTrkCad$ moves the End-Points of the selected tracks as necessary to meet the connecting curve.  
In some cases the connecting track will be straight.  
If the selected End-Points are close to each other and aligned then the two 
are connected directly.

If enabled,
$XEasements|cmdEasement|Help,Misc,Easements$ 
will be automatically generated between 
tracks of differing radii.  
When using easements, there is a minimum radius as specified in the $BEasement$ dialog.  
You are not allowed to join tracks with less then this radius and the 
connecting track's radius must be greater than the minimum radius.

If there any errors while joining tracks (such moving beyond the end of a
track or using a curve with a radius smaller than the Easement radius),
then the joint track will be drawn in Red.
This serves as a visual cue that the connecting track can not be created.

Any tracks that are created during the Join command will have the following properties inherited from the first track: selected state, hidden state, scale, track gauge and Layer.

$XTurnouts and Sectional|cmdHotBar$ tracks can be joined to other tracks.  
$BXTrkCad$ extends the selected End-Point with a straight track to use in 
making the connection.  

You can join to a $XTurntable|cmdTurntable$, 
but the Turntable must be used as the second End-Point.

You also join to or from a $XCircle|cmdCircle$ which converts the Circle into a Curved track.

?cMoving To Join Tracks:|||

You can move $Xselected|cmdSelect$ tracks to join with another track.  All the selected
tracks are moved and rotated so the End-Points are aligned.

$BShift-Left-Click$ on two unconnected End-Points.  One must be $Bselected$ and the other
$Bunselected$.  The two End-Points will be joined by moving the $Bselected$ tracks.

See the Demos for examples of how to join tracks.


?BConnect Tracks|cmdConnect|bconnect|Commands;Connect Tracks
?Tcommands

This command is used with $BSectional Track$.

Occasionally pieces of
sectional track do not line up exactly, especially when creating figure-8's or passing sidings.  When laying out the actual track you can compensate for this by adjusting the individual tracks to provide a bit of slack.
This command simulates this process.

Click on each End-Point of the tracks you trying to connect.  Tracks will be moved slightly to overcome the gap.  If the gap is too large, the connection will fail, and you should try using other track pieces in your layout.

$BXTrkCad$ adjusts the positions of tracks connected to the tracks up to a track with more than two connections.  See the Demo for details.

If one (or both) the selected tracks is an Adjustable Section (such as Kato's Adjustable Track #20-050) then length of the track is changed to fill the gap.

You can undo the effect of the $BConnect$ command by $XSplitting|cmdSplitTrack$ the track to disconnect them and then use $BConnect$ command with $BShift-Left-Click$ on the unconnected End-Points to tighten the connections between the tracks. 


?? mswword
?Q
??
?BSplit Track|cmdSplitTrack|bsplit|Commands;Modify Track;Splitting Tracks;Block Gaps
?Tcommands
The $BSplit$ command splits a track into two pieces at the selected point.  

If you select an End-Point of a track then the tracks are disconnected.
Otherwise, the track is split at the selected point, but the two tracks
remain connected.
To split and disconnect at a point, $Bsplit$ the track twice, (first splits and the second disconnects).

You cannot create a track shorter than the $XMinimum Track Length|cmdPref$.

This command is useful for placing tunnel portals or $XElevation Points|cmdElev$ at specific places.

Normally, you can not split a Turnout.  
If you hold the $BShift$ key then you can $BTrim$ a Turnout which replaces the portion of the Turnout between the split point and the End-Point with $Bflex-track$.
For Turnouts with more than one set of $XTurnout Points|defTurnoutPoints$, such as a Slip Switch or Scissors Crossover, you can not select a point between the $BPoints$.

$XShift-Right-Click|defRightClick$ displays a popup menu which can be used change the $Bblock gaps$ for the End-Point.  A block gap is drawn as a thick line at the End-Point.  Either or both rails can be gapped.

?BElevations|cmdElev|belev|Commands;Elevations;Modify Track
?Tcommands

The $BElevation$ command changes the Elevation of track End-Points.

?Gcelev

An End-Point can have one of several Elevation types:
?LSo
?LI
$BNone$ - no elevation defined.
?LI
$BDefined$ - a defined elevation at a specified height.
?LI
$BHidden$ - a defined elevation but not displayed on the layout.
?LI
$BComputed$ - height is based on height of closest neighbors.
?LI
$BGrade$ - grade is based on height of closest neighbors.
?LI
$BIgnored$ - End-Point is not considered in computations.
?LI
$BStation$ - assigns a name to the End-Point.
?LE

$BNote:$ Each End-Point can have only one of these attributes.
For example, an End-Point can not be a Defined Elevation and a Station at the same time.

In this command, $BDefined Elevation$ End-Points are indicated on the layout by Gold colored dots.
$BIgnored Elevation$ End-Points are indicated by Blue colored dots.

When an End-Point is selected on the layout by $BLeft-Click$, it is highlighted by a large Red dot and its Elevation type and values are displayed in the dialog.

$BShift-Left-Click$ splits the track at the specified point to add an Elevation point to the middle of a track.

The grade at the specified End-Point is displayed next to the $BGrade$ radio button.
For $BDefined Elevation$ End-Points, the grade on each side of the End-Point is displayed.

$BDefined Elevation$ End-Points are used to specify fixed heights of track End-Points.
Typically, this would be where grade changes or where clearances must be maintained.
Between $BDefined Elevation$ End-Points you can place $BComputed$ Elevations and $BGrade$ markers.
These values are not entered directly but are Computed Dynamically based on the $BDefined Elevations$ of connected tracks.
This allows you label elevations at intermediate End-Points without having the enter specific values.
You can also place $BComputed$ markers between a $BDefined Elevation$ point and the end of a track.

$BStations$ are used to provide information for the $XProfile|cmdProfile$ command.

All $BElevation$ (including $BGrade$ and $BStation$) labels are drawn on the layout outlined in boxes.  These may be moved by the $XMove Label|cmdMoveLabel$ command.  In addition, $BGrade$ labels have an arrow indicating the upwards direction.

?Gdchgelev

The $XTools|toolsM$ Menu contains commands to Remove or Raise/Lower the Elevations from selected tracks.  The entered value is added to all Defined Elevations on Selected tracks.  A negative value will lower the Elevations.

?? mswword
?P
??
?cComputing Dynamic Elevations|||

?Hcomputingelevations
Elevations of Tracks are computed in following steps.  
The colors listed in each step are used as the background color of the
Track Elevation Markers (if they are $Xenabled|optionLabelEnable$).
?LS1
?LI
The Shortest Paths between all $BDefined Elevations$ are computed.  
A Path stops at $BIgnored$ or $BDefined$ End-Points.
The Elevation of any Turnouts on these Paths with more than two connections 
are computed as the average Elevation inversely weighted by distance along the tracks to the
$BDefined Elevation$ points ($BBlue$).
?LI
The Elevation of any other tracks on the Shortest Paths are computed based on the distance along the tracks from the Turnouts computed in the first step and/or the $BDefined Elevation$ points ($BPurple$).
?LI
The Elevation of any remaining tracks is computed based on the average Elevation
of the tracks found in the first two steps that they
are (directly or indirectly) connected to,
inversely weighted by geometric distance ($BGold$).
?LI
Any remaining tracks are not connected to a $BDefined Elevation$ and do not have an Elevation.
?LE

The Elevation Computation is performed incrementally every time the layout is changed to keep all Elevations
in sync.
The performance of the computation is affected by the placement of the $BDefined Elevation$ End-Points and the number of Paths between them.
Place the $BDefined Elevations$ at points where tracks begin to branch (such as the throat of a yard or at the ends of a siding).
Also, use $BDefined Elevations$ to break the layout into areas so recomputation has fewer tracks and Paths to deal with.

?BProfile|cmdProfile|bprofile|Commands;Profile;Elevations;Modify Track
?Tcommands

The $BProfile$ dialog draws a profile showing Elevations, Distances and Grades for a $BPath$ on the layout.

?Gcprofile

Choose a $BPath$ by $BLeft-Clicking$ on End-Points.
As each End-Point is chosen, the Path is extended via the shortest route.
Selecting the end of the $BPath$ trims the $BPath$ back to a last $BDefined Elevation$ point (if any, otherwise the $BPath$ is cleared).

If no route is possible an error message is displayed.
There are several reasons why this might happen:
?LSo
?LI
The tracks are not connected.  Check this by $BShift-Left-Click$ing on one track using the $XSelect|cmdSelect$ command.
This selects all tracks connected (directly or indirectly).
See if the other track is selected.
?LI
One of the End-Points on the route is $XIgnored|cmdElev$.  Look for Blue dots on the expected $BPath$ when using the $BProfile$ or $XElevation|cmdElev$ commands.
?LI
The only route connects to a section of track that is already on the $BPath$ and is not the end of the $BPath$.
Remove the end of the $BPath$ until the connected track is not on the $BPath$.
?LE

The $BPath$ is drawn in the $XProfile Color|cmdRgbcolor$ (default Purple) on the Layout.

If the shortest $BPath$ is not what you want, you can choose End-Points that are closer to the end of the $BPath$.
Also, you can $XIgnore|cmdElev$ End-Points to prevent the $BPath$ from choosing a route through that End-Point.
$XShift-Right-Click|defRightClick$ displays a popup-menu that allows you to change the specified End-Point to be a $BDefined$, $BIgnored$ or $BNone$ Elevation End-Point.

Each $BDefined Elevation$ End-Point on the $BPath$ is drawn as a Vertical bar, labeled with its height and distance from the beginning of the $BPath$.

The $BGrade$ between points is displayed between the Vertical bars.
The $BGrade$ line is drawn in Blue if that portion of the $BPath$ does not contain more than one Shortest Path between Defined Elevation End-Points.
Otherwise it is drawn in Red, to indicate the grade is an average and the actual grade may vary for any particular track segment.
See $XComputing Dynamic Elevation|computingelevations$ for more details.

$BStations$ on the $BPath$ are displayed along the bottom of the $BProfile$.

You can change the heights of $BDefined Elevations$ by $BLeft-Dragging$ on the Profile Window.
As you $BDrag$, the new Elevation and Grades to each side are displayed at the bottom of the Profile dialog.

The $BDone$ button closes the dialog.

The $BClear$ button removes all points from the $BPath$.

The $BPrint$ button prints the dialog.  The aspect ratio is preserved on the print-out.
You will probably want to print in Landscape format.


?BMove Label|cmdMoveLabel|bmovedes|Commands;Move Labels
?Tcommands

This command is used to move $XElevations, Grades and Stations|cmdElev$, $XCurved Track|cmdCurve$, $XHelix|cmdHelix$ or $XTurnout|cmdHotBar$ Labels.

Drag the Label to a new position.  The Label's new position is relative to the End-Point or Turnout and will move along with the track if the track is moved.

This operation can also be invoked by the $BControl-Left-Drag$ from the $XSelect|cmdSelect$ command.

$XShift-Right-Click|defRightClick$ is used to toggle the display of individual $XCurved Track|cmdCurve$, $XHelix|cmdHelix$ or $XTurnout|cmdHotBar$ Labels.

The $BExit$ button terminates the Train Simulation and returns to Layout Design mode.

?Gtrainbar

$BSelecting New Cars$

The Hot Bar contains the Cars and Locomotives which are have not been placed on the Layout.
Cars are created and managed using the $XCar Inventory|cmdCarinv$ dialog.

Each item on the Hot Bar can represent a group of Cars.
Cars can be grouped by Prototype, Manufacturer and/or Part Number.
They can also be listed as individual Car Items.
This grouping is controlled by $BCar Labels$ Drop Down List on the $XDisplay|cmdDisplay$ dialog.

To place a Car, select it from the Hot Bar.
If the Hot Bar is displaying Cars in groups (and not as individual Car Items) then a Drop Down List is displayed on the $XStatus Bar|statusBar$ containing the individual Car Items in that group.

$Gbnewcar$ If you are not displaying the Hot Bar, then the $BNew Car$ button will be shown on the Tool Bar.
Pressing this button will display the Drop Down List on the $XStatus Bar|statusBar$ containing all of your Car Items that have not yet been placed on the layout.

$BPlacing Cars$

Once you have selected a new Car, or have selected an existing Car on the Layout, you can position it by dragging it on the Layout.
If the Car is coupled to other Cars then the whole set of Cars is moved.
If you place the Car on a Track, then Car (and the other coupled Cars) will be aligned along the track.

Note: if you move the tracks but not the cars (or vice-versa) using the $XMove|cmdMove$ or $XRotate|cmdRotate$ commands the cars will not remain attached to the tracks.  If the cars are moved close to a track, then they will be aligned when the $BTrain Simulation$ command is next invoked.

$BCoupling Cars$

If you move a Car along a track to another Car then the Cars will be coupled together.
To uncouple Cars, Right-Click between the Cars and select Uncouple from the pop-up menu.

$BTrains$

A Train consists of one or more Locomotives coupled to other Cars.
One Locomotive will be the $BMU Master$ for the Train.
The $BMU Master$ can be changed by Right-Clicking on a Locomotive and selecting $BMU Master$ from the pop-up menu.
The $BMU Master$ is drawn with a solid Yellow head light indicating the direction is moving.
If a Train is split by uncoupling between Locomotives, then two Trains will be created, each with their own $BMU Master$

$BTrain Control$

?Gtrain

The $BTrain Control$ dialog is used to set the speed and direction of Trains.
The dialog contains a list of Trains (listed by their $BMU Master$ Locomotive).
Before each Train on the list is either a Red circle (indicating the Train is stopped) or a Green circle (indicating the Train is moving).

Any number of Trains can be running, although it might be difficult to keep track of more than a few.

For the selected Train, the Train Control dialog lists
?LSo

?LE


$BTrain Operation$

Once a Train is moving, it will continue to move until it is Stopped manually, hits the end of track or an open Turnout.
If the Train 'runs into' other Cars, those Cars will be coupled to the Train.
If Train's speed is faster than the $XMax Coupling Speed|maxcouplingspeed$ then the Train will crash and must be manually moved back onto the track.

If two Trains are coupled, one of the two $BMU Masters$ will be chosen as the $BMU Master$ for the combined Train.

The motion of all Trains can be Paused by clicking the $BGo/Stop$ button on the Main Window Tool Bar.
Pressing the $BEscape$ key has the same effect as clicking on the $BStop$ button.
This allows you set Turnout positions or make other changes.

?BUpdate Titles|cmdUpdatetitle||3 part titles; Update

?Gupdttl

The 2.0.0 version of $BXTrkCad$ introduced a change in the way Turnouts and Structures are named.
The new method splits the title into 3 parts: Manufacturer, Description and Part Number.

To help you when upgrading to the new version, $BXTrkCad$ detects, when loading an
old $BXTrkCad$ layout file, if the layout uses Turnouts and Structures that have
titles in the old format.  If so this dialog is displayed which allows you
to change the titles in your layout to the new format.

The title of each different type of Turnout is collected and presented in this
dialog.  Simply select the Turnout on the list that matches the one displayed and
click 'Update'.  Repeat for each type of Turnout in your layout.

If there is no matching Turnout, click on Ignore.  The Turnout will retain the
old name as the Description, with a blank Manufacturer and Part Number.

Click Cancel to continue loading the file without updating the titles.

If you Save your file without updating all the titles you will not be able to
update the titles later.

If you are looking at old files without making changes then Click on Cancel to load the file without Updates.

Not updating the titles prevents the customization of the way titles are presented in various lists and on the layout.  Basic operation of $BXTrkCad$ is not affected.
